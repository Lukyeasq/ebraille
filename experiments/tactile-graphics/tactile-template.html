		<h2>Directions</h2>
		
		<p>When submitting a tactile graphic  for use in development of the E-braille specification, please make a copy of this template and fill in all items marked with "xxx" and rename the file to be the same as the graphic, i.e., a file with the name of "duck.jpg" would also have a file called "duck.html" in the same folder. The "img" and the "a" markup is commented out, so remove the commented out  markup. There is an example of commented out markup below this paragraph, but you will only see it in a text editor and a browser will hide it.</p>
		
		<!--The les than, bang, dash, dash starts the start of a commented out section.
			and the dash, dash, greater ends the commented out section -->
