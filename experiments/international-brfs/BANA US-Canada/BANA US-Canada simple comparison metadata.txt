Notes:
1. In the US and Canada, there are three basic styles of heading: h1 (centred), h2 (cell-5) and h3 (cell-7).

2. Headings referred to as "Paragraph headings" are brailled as they appear in print.

3. Normally the hollow and square bullets would need to be included on a special Symbols Page or in a Transcriber's Note. No Transcriber's Note was added to this file.

4. Standard paper sizes are 11.5x11 and 8.5x11. While this is an agency decision, 11.5x11 tends to be the default and was used for this transcription.
