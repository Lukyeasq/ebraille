# eBraille experiments

The [experiments folder](https://github.com/daisy/ebraille/tree/master/experiments) lists various
initiatives (example files, books, publications, etc.) that have been undertaken as part of the
development of the [eBraille format](https://daisy.github.io/ebraille/). These experiments may
become obsolete as the format evolves, but are retained here nevertheless.

## Tactile graphics

To aid in understanding the needs and requirements for tactile graphics in the eBraille format,
a collection of graphic experiments are being developed in the [tactile-graphics
 subfolder](https://github.com/daisy/ebraille/tree/master/experiments/tactile-graphics/)

Organizations that have contributed samples may have made the contributions been based on
copyrighted images from textbooks. However, the tactile graphics themselves are independent of the
image which inspired the tactile graphic. If a publisher feels that the tactile graphic in any way
infringes on an image they have rights to, after being notified, we will promptly remove the tactile
graphic from the collection.
