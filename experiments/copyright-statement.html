<h1>Copyright Information about Experiments and Samples</h1>

<p>In support of the  development of the E-braille specification, organizations have made contributions of experiments and samples, e.g., tactile graphics. These contributions may have been based on copyrighted images from textbooks. However, the tactile graphics themselves are independent of the image which inspired the tactile graphic. If a publisher feels that the tactile graphic in any way infringes on an image they have rights to, after being notified, we will promptly remove the tactile graphic from the collection. </p>

<p>Any company or organization that submits an experiment  or sample must agree to make the contribution under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.</p>
