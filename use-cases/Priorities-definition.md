# Definition of use cases priorities

## High priority
 Assuming we have a stable EBraille standard available in late 2023 or in 2024, these are the use cases without which the first version of the standard will not be viable.

## Medium priority
We may not address these use cases immediately, but we make sure that design of the standard support these use cases. So that we can address these use cases in future version of the standard.

## Low priority
These are the use cases which we would not address. It means it would be out of scope.
